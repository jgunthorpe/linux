* General purpose MMIO GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "linux,basic-mmio-gpio" or "linux,basic-mmio-gpio-be",
  the choice determines which bit is considered GPIO #0
- reg and reg-names: An array of named register ranges describing the windows,
  in one of these combinations:
   * 'dat' - Single input/output data register.
   * 'dat', 'set' and 'clr' - 'dat' is the input and drive 1 writes high to 'set'
                              and drive 0 writes high to 'clr'
   * 'dat' and 'set' - 'dat' is the input and drive 1 write high to 'set' and
                       drive 0 writes low to set
  Additionally one of these may be specified:
   * dirout - Write 1 to set as output, 0 to set as input
   * dirin - Write 1 to set as input, 0 to set as output

  The size of the registers should be 1, 4 or 8.
- #gpio-cells: Should be two.
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.

Example:
	gpio0: gpio@8 {
	        #gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "linux,basic-mmio-gpio";
		gpio-controller;
		reg-names = "dat", "set", "dirin";
		reg = <0x8 4>, <0xc 4>, <0x10 4>;
	};
