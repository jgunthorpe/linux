	 * This is called by dma_buf_sgt_map_attachment() and is used to map a
	 * shared &dma_buf into device address space, and it is mandatory. It
	 * can only be called if @attach has been called successfully.
	 *
	 * This call may sleep, e.g. when the backing storage first needs to be
	 * allocated, or moved to a location suitable for all currently attached
	 * devices.
	 *
	 * Note that any specific buffer attributes required for this function
	 * should get added to device_dma_parameters accessible via
	 * &device.dma_params from the &dma_buf_attachment. The @attach callback
	 * should also check these constraints.
	 *
	 * If this is being called for the first time, the exporter can now
	 * choose to scan through the list of attachments for this buffer,
	 * collate the requirements of the attached devices, and choose an
	 * appropriate backing storage for the buffer.
	 *
	 * Based on enum dma_data_direction, it might be possible to have
	 * multiple users accessing at the same time (for reading, maybe), or
	 * any other kind of sharing that the exporter might wish to make
	 * available to buffer-users.
	 *
	 * This is always called with the dmabuf->resv object locked when
	 * the dynamic_mapping flag is true.
	 *
	 * Note that for non-dynamic exporters the driver must guarantee that
	 * that the memory is available for use and cleared of any old data by
	 * the time this function returns.  Drivers which pipeline their buffer
	 * moves internally must wait for all moves and clears to complete.
	 * Dynamic exporters do not need to follow this rule: For non-dynamic
	 * importers the buffer is already pinned through @pin, which has the
	 * same requirements. Dynamic importers otoh are required to obey the
	 * dma_resv fences.
	 *
	 * Returns:
	 *
	 * A &sg_table scatter list of the backing storage of the DMA buffer,
	 * already mapped into the device address space of the &device attached
	 * with the provided &dma_buf_attachment. The addresses and lengths in
	 * the scatter list are PAGE_SIZE aligned.
	 *
	 * On failure, returns a negative error value wrapped into a pointer.
	 * May also return -EINTR when a signal was received while being
	 * blocked.
	 *
	 * Note that exporters should not try to cache the scatter list, or
	 * return the same one for multiple calls. Caching is done either by the
	 * DMA-BUF code (for non-dynamic importers) or the importer. Ownership
	 * of the scatter list is transferred to the caller, and returned by
	 * @unmap_dma_buf.
